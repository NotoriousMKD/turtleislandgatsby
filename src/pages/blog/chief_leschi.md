# Chief Leschi

Chief Leschi was a chief of the Nisqually Indian Tribe of southern Puget Sound, Washington, primarily in the area of the Nisqually River.


Known for his role in the Yakima War and general resistance to participating in the selling of Tribal land, Chief Leschi was a staunch defender of Nisqually lands and of his people's traditional way of life and sovereignty. He was charged with murder and hung by the US government in 1857 . In 2004, the Washington state legislature passed resolutions stating that Leschi was wrongly convicted and executed, and vacated his sentence. He was exonerated by a unanimous vote.
