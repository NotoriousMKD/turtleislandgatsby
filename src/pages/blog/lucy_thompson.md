# Lucy Thompson

Lucy Thompson was a Native American author known for her book To the American Indian: Reminiscences of a Yurok Woman. Written in 1916, the book is intended to preserve her people's stories. She was a champion of her people, bringing to light the genocide of Native Californians, as well as over-fishing by non-Natives.
