# Chief Ouray
Chief Ouray was acknowledged by the United States government as a chief of the Ute and he traveled to Washington, D.C. to negotiate for the welfare of the Utes. Ouray met with Presidents Lincoln, Grant, and Hayes and was called the man of peace because he sought to make treaties with settlers and the government, and was a constant force for peace. He tried to secure a treaty for the Uncompahgre Ute - who wanted to stay in Colorado - but was unsuccessful. His band was forced to a reservation in Utah in 1881. Chief Ouray had been a negotiator during the Treaty of Conejos (1863), wherein the Utes exchanged the loss of 50% of their land for the right to live in Western Colorado in perpetuity.
