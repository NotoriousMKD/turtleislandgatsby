# Gvnagadoga/Standing Turkey

Standing Turkey was the First Beloved Man of the Cherokee after his father (of the same name) died in 1760. He held this title until 1761. During this time he led the Cherokee in a war against the English, in what is known as the Anglo - Cherokee War. He is also noted for being a member of several delegations to visit London and Spanish Louisiana, seeking refuge from American encroachment for his people.
