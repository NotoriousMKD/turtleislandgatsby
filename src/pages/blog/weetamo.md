# Weetamo

Weetamo grew up in the Pocassetâ€™s largest and main village, Mettapoisett, on the shores of Cape Cod. She was the daughter of  Corbitant, sachem of the Pocasset tribe. She later became sunksqua (female sachem) herself . During her lifetime, she had five husbands: Winnepurket, Wamsutta (Alexander), Quequequanachet, Petonowit, and Quinnapin. Weetamoo had responsibilities as a bead-worker, making the wampum which told the story of her people and what they were presently enduring. This was a highly-respected position. In 1675, she joined in King Phillip's War, helping to attack colonists with her 300 warriors. At her command, they made multiple raids against colonial settlements. In 1676 her encampment was surprised, and she drowned in the Taunton River trying to escape. King Phillip had also been killed just before this. Knowledge of these two deaths largely broke the spirit of resistance. Some of Weetamo's relatives were sold shortly after this into slavery, and sent to the West Indies. Weetamo remains a much-revered example of Native American resistance and cultural pride.
