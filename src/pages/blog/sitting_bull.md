# Sitting Bull

Sitting Bull was a spiritual and war leader revered by his People. He led his band during a time of constant change and upheaval, refusing to engage in selling Tribal land or signing treaties. He is well known for his involvement in Red Cloud's War, the Battle of the Greasy Grass (Little Big Horn), and many other key and decisive battles during the 1860's and 70's. Sitting Bull later was involved in Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show, traveling extensively and performing for large audiences. He was assassinated while being arrested for his acknowledgment of the Ghost Dance. 


"I wish it to be remembered that I was the last man of my tribe to surrender my rifle."
