# King Calusa 
King Calusa was paramount Chief of the large Calusa chiefdom, which covered most of southwestern Florida and the Florida Keys. From his capital on Mound Key in Estero Bay near Fort Myers, King Calusa reigned over approximately 50 villages and 100,000 people stretching over a vast area. He was Chief at the time of contact with the Spanish under Pedro Menéndez de Avilés. When Avila arrived in 1566, tension eventually arose. After Chief Calusa attempted to assassinate Avila, he himself was eventually killed. Several places in the region still retain his name.
