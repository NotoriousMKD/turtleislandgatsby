# Black Hawk

Black Hawk was a Sauk war chief for whom a war is named after: Black Hawk's War. He fought on the side of the British during the War of 1812, hoping to expel American settlers from the frontier. In 1832 he and his warriors initiated Black Hawk's War, during which he and others were captured. Brought to the East Coast in an effort to impress on him the size and population of U.S. cities, he eventually was interviewed for his autobiography. His was the first published autobiography of a Native American in the United States. Black Hawk participated in and led innumerable battles across several decades. He is widely revered among Native Americans today for his steadfast resolve to protect his homeland and fight against illegal treaties.


"How smooth must be the language of the whites, when they can make right look like wrong, and wrong like right." â€“ Black Hawk
