# Chief Billy Bowlegs/Halpuda Mikko
Bowlegs was one of the last Seminole resisters of the Seminole Wars. After the treacherous killing of Osceola - and the death or capture of several other Seminole leaders-  Bowlegs and his band of 200 warriors became some of the most prominent fighters surviving at the time hostilities ended officially on 14 August 1842. His band continued to evade capture until the Third Seminole War, when the US government sent an Oklahoma Seminole Chief to seek him out and offer money and land in Indian Territory in exchange for surrender. Eventually, his band moved. Billy Bowlegs later gained fame as a captain in the Union Army during the American Civil War.
