# Viola Jimulla
Viola Jimulla was the Chief of the Prescott Yavapai tribe . She is considered the first contemporary Native American female Chief of a Western U.S. Tribe. Under Jimullaâ€™s leadership, the Prescott Yavapai Tribal Council was formed to better ensure the people's voice in their own governing. Her leadership helped the Yavapais achieve better living conditions and more modern facilities than most other tribes.
