# Mountain Wolf Woman (XÃ©hachiwinga)
Her autobiography was one of the earliest firsthand accounts of the experience of a Native American woman.  Mountain Wolf Woman, Sister of Crashing Thunder, details seventy-five years of Native American life and the role of women in native cultures, and was seen as an important contrast to her brother Sam Blowsnake's book from thirty-five years earlier.
