# Lyda Conley
Lyda Conley was the first Native American woman to argue a case before the U.S. Supreme Court . She was also the first woman admitted to the Kansas Bar Association.


Her case appears to be the first in which "a plaintiff argued that the burying grounds of Native Americans were entitled to federal protection." At the heart of the case was her Tribe's  The Huron Indian Cemetery, which was under threat of purchase for development. She spent her entire life defending the cemetery, and is buried there.
