# Lucy Tayiah Eads

Lucy Tayiah Eads was the first woman to serve as principal chief of the Kaw Nation. Eads was trained as a nurse at Haskell Institute. In 1924 Eads delivered a petition to the Commission of Indian Affairs in Washington, D.C., to reestablish the Kaw Agency. She was invited to the 1929 presidential inauguration for Herbert Hoover and Charles Curtis, vice president from Kansas, and fellow Kaw. Eads made education a priority for her people.
