# Running Eagle
Running Eagle was a woman warrior. From an early age she preferred male roles. During a hunting expedition in which her group was attacked by Assiniboine warriors, she saved her father's life. In later years she joined war parties. During her first one she captured 11 Crow horses. Although there was strong resistance against a woman participating in raids, she was nonetheless eventually invited to participate in men's ceremonies and warrior societies. During a raid against the Flathead, she was targeted and killed. She remains one of the most famous women in Blackfeet history.
