# William Terrill Bradby 
William Terrill Bradby was born on the Pamunkey Reservation, and served as a Union soldier during the Civil War. He was also a land guide and scout for the Army of the Potomac. Even after VIrginia declared itself to be part of the Confederacy, Bradby continued to clandestinely work for the Union. He died around 1905 on the same reservation he was born on. The Pamunkey did not gain federal recognition until 2016, living in their traditional homeland for 400 years since contact with no real security.
