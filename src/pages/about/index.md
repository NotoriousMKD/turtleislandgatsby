# The TIHOH Project
Turtle Island is a term many native people used for what is now known as North America. The turtle represents strength, perseverance, and creationism.

## Mission

Our Mission is to build and continually develop the Turtle Island Hall of Honor which will be a place that honors past, present, and future Native American heroes.

## Purpose

To give Native American youth positive role models; past, present, and future
To create pride in Native American Heritage
To provide a place for preservation of Native wisdom (i.e. environmental, ecological, herbal, medicinal, etc…)
To provide awareness of Native consciousness to the general public (i.e. all things are connected therefore related, the circle, four directions, medicine wheel, etc…)
To present the history of Turtle Island from the perspective of the people that made and are making that history; our heroes, past, present, and future
To convey this history, awareness, and pride through art, living exhibits, location and building, thereby bringing alive what residents of Turtle Island are thinking and feeling
